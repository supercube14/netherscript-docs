# What is NetherScript?
NetherScript is a hard fork of [CBScript](https://github.com/SethBling/cbscript) by [SethBling](https://github.com/SethBling), maintained by the [MapVerse](https://mapverse.net) community. It is focused on making Minecraft maps instead of just datapacks.

This project will become a system of tools, but right now is only the language and compiler. It has many higher level language features that don't exist at the Minecraft command level.
